//we use react in dynamic website
//react  is the easy way to write html css and js
//npm run dev/build spit the react code to html css and js
//why react --->> its harder to make dom manipulation execute 
//dynamic or react jargons
//worry 2 things
//1---->>> state components
//state the things that change in counter the count is the state.
//components---> how does the application looks like how dom element should render
//in linkdin the home network jobs notifications are the components
//a satate change triggers a re render a re render represent thr dom being
//manipulated when the state chnage
//final conclusion
//define all your components at once 
//and all have to do is to update the state react takes care of re rendring your app
//never do dom in react just in specific cases 
//anything start with use is a hook
//some more jargons VDOM  DIFFING BULK UPDATES RECONCILLATION
//npm create vite@lates to install the react in your codebase
